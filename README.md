# A project from my UI Design course at Columbia University

I replicated the classic arcade game, whack-a-mole, using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of async/await functions in Javascript.

I also used jquery to interact with the DOM.


## Getting started:

* Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/yuval-krn/whack-a-mole.git`
* Use either the "Live Server" extension in VS Code or simply click on whack.html within your document viewer to launch game in browser
